\section*{6.8 Intermediate Forms and l'Hospital's Rule}

\subsection*{l'Hospital's Rule}

\begin{definition}
Suppose \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable and \( g'(x) \neq 0 \) on an open interval \(I\) that contains \(a\) (except possibly at \(a\)). Suppose that
\[ \lim_{x \to a} f(x)=0 \quad \text{ and } \quad \lim_{x \to a} g(x)=0 \]
or that 
\[ \lim_{x \to a} f(x)= \pm \infty \quad \text{ and } \quad \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \pm \infty \]
Then 
\[ \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \]
if the limit on the right side exists (or is \( \pm \infty \)).
\end{definition}

\subsection*{Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem}

\begin{definition}
Suppose that the function \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b)\), and \(g'(x) \neq 0\) for all \(x\) in \((a, b)\). Then there is a number \(c\) in \((a, b)\) such that 
\[ \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \]
\end{definition}
