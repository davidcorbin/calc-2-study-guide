\section*{9.3 Separable Differential Equations}

A \textbf{separable equation} is a first-order differential equation in which the expression for \(dy/dx\) can be factored as a function of \(x\) times a function of \(y\). This means that it can be written in the form
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)f(x) \]
To solve an equation, rewrite it in the differential form
\[ h(y)dy = g(x)dx \]
so that all the \(y\)'s and \(x\)'s are on opposite sides. Then integrate both sides of the equation.
