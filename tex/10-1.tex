\section*{10.1 Curves Defined by Parametric Equations}

A \textbf{parametric equation} is an equation in which \(x\) and \(y\) are given as functions of a third variable \(t\).
\[ x=f(t) \quad y=g(t) \]
In general, the curve with parametric equations
\[x=f(t) \quad y=g(t) \quad a \leq t \leq b\]
has \textbf{initial point} \((f(a), g(a))\) and \textbf{terminal point} \((f(b), g(b))\).
