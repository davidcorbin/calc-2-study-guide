\subsection*{Formula for integration by parts}

\begin{definition}

From the product rule we see that if $f$ and $g$ are differentiable, then

\[ \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x) \]

We can rearrange this as

% \! brings closer together - \, pushes apart
\[ \int \! f(x)g'(x) \, dx = f(x)g(x) - \int \! g(x)f'(x) \, dx \]

Let $u = f(x)$ and $v = g(x)$, then

\[ \int \! u \, dv = uv - \int \! v \, du \]

This is the formula for integration by parts.

\end{definition}
