\section*{11.4 The Comparison Tests}

Suppose that \(\sum{a_n}\) and \(\sum{b_n}\) are series with positive terms.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(\sum{b_n}\) is convergent and \(a_n \leq b_n\) for all \(n\),
then \(\sum{a_n}\) is also convergent.
    \item If \(\sum{b_n}\) is divergent and \(a_n \geq b_n\) for all \(n\), then
\(\sum{a_n}\) is also divergent.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Limit Comparison Test}

Suppose that \(\sum{a_n}\) and \(\sum{b_n}\) are series with positive terms. If
\[\lim_{n \to \infty}{\frac{a_n}{b_n}} = c\]
where \(c\) is a finite number and \(c > 0\), then either both series converge
or both diverge.
